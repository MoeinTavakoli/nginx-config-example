### installation 

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nginx
```

### Configuration 

The heart of Nginx's configuration resides in the `/etc/nginx` directory on Unix-based systems (such as Linux).

In this directory, you will find the Nginx configuration files, with the primary configuration file typically named nginx.conf.

The /etc/nginx directory is where administrators and developers can fine-tune Nginx to meet their specific needs. By editing the configuration files, you can define server blocks, manage proxy and load balancing, configure SSL/TLS settings, set up virtual hosts, and optimize various server parameters.
